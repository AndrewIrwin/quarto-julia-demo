# Quarto-Julia-Demo

These are notes to demonstrate how to use Quarto to write documents that incorporate Julia code and computation results.

Quarto is a publishing system building on the ideas of R markdown and other literate programing and documentation systems. It is particularly well suited to developing expositions (blogs, course notes, books, slide presentations) targetting both web and pdf formats that combine natural language, computer code (julia, python, R), and output from the code. There is support for LaTeX-style equations, figures and tables with captions and cross-references, BibTeX-style citations.
